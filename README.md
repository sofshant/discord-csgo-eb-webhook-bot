api to send webhook message on edgebug or jumpbug.

dc enough to go in details so ill summarize what to do.

1) install nodejs (https://nodejs.org/en/)
2) edit the config.js file and do whatever u want
3) type node server.js to run it

as for the api, make a post request to http(s)://yoursite.tld/hit/ along with a header called user (username), type (either eb for edgebug or jb for jumpbug), and map (whatever map the user is in)
message me on discord (Sofshant#0001) for any issues.
